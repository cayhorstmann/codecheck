* Course

For reusing assignments in coming semester, need notion of course. null course if none given.

Concept 1: Course knows its assignments

Course has assignments

Name     Deadline     URL   [View submissions]  [Delete]


Trash [Empty]

Name     Deadline     URL   [View submissions]  [Undelete]


Existing assignments are cloned into course
New assignments have same edit key as course (course owner owns assignments)

Can download all submissions in course

Can clone entire course

Concept 2: Course is simply a tag

&tag=... for submissions, filter by tag

* Elements

** horstmann_codecheck might as well get the file data if they don't currently exist. Just do this in JavaScript:
               String fileData = new String(url.openStream().readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
               String replacement = "<div class='horstmann_codecheck'><script type='text/javascript'>//<![CDATA[\n" +
"horstmann_codecheck.setup.push({\n" +
"url: 'https://codecheck.it/checkNJS', repo: 'cs046', problem: '" + id + "',\n" +
                  fileData.substring(1) +
                  ")\n// ]]>\n</script></div>\n";



** horstmann_vitalsource (which is part of horstmann_all_min) defines

  horstmann_config.score_change_listener 
  horstmann_config.retrieve_state

  This should be moved to horstmann_common if not VS specific

** Use client UI for interactivities.ws/makews script; in general, try to use client UI

But careful with randomized param.js. Can one even use cookies? Use ccid param with fileData and be sure to send the same param back up. Or maybe fileData includes it?

** You are right about the vertical lines. They shouldn't appear when the solved problem is restored. I fixed that in my code,

** Long-term want proof that students have the book. Make them solve a trivial problem and store unlock code as the problem state

* Parsons Problems

//TILE

makes each line a tile, except includes following {

//GOOD
moves to the left

//BAD code
Adds to the distractors of the preceding line (unless at the end)

Anything before the first //TILE is implicitly GOOD

Parsing yields a data structure
{ left: [ GOOD strings ], right: [ strings or [ correct/distractors ]] }

The items on the right are delivered scrambled, and so are the groups of correct/distractors

Hi Rance,

unfortunately, CALL doesn't work with the TOLERANCE, IGNORECASE, and IGNORESPACE pseudocomments. This would be a nice change going forward, but I don't know how to implement it in Python. I would need to write a Python function 

deepEqual(x, y, tolerance, ignorecase, ignorespace) 

that checks whether x and y are equal except if they are doubles, use the tolerance, if they are strings, use ignorecase/ignorespace (I know how to do this part), and if they are sequences such as lists, sets, or tuples, do this recursively for the elements. I guess I should see if something is iterable (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952464/in-python-how-do-i-determine-if-an-object-is-iterable). This seems like a good thing to do in the long run, and I am adding it to the wish list.---

Another "to be fixed eventually" problem

When using the picture class, if the image is not found and exception is thrown but then the student gets a pass and full marks. 

Here is the report.

http://www.codecheck.it/fetch/17072919018705920314428255902/report.html

This happened because I forgot to include the image, but the same thing would happen if the student misspelled the file name

Can we compare numbers by significant digits rather than by epsilon?

score and maxscore in new JSON instead of score/maxscore?

codecheck -j hw1a

http -j POST cs20.cs.sjsu.edu:8080/checkJson < /data/temp/test.json



We need a bunch of permissions for Jackson and could put that
into /opt/codecheck/lib/jackson and add it to the classpath.

JUnit only needs

  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers";

and we grant that to students and testers so they can do stuff with reflection

This reorg would deal with an attack where a student puts arbitrary code into a JUnit test file.

Shouldn't run two tests

AIOOBE in image calculation didn't get displayed :-(

http://wiley.code-check.org/codecheck/files?repo=bjlo2&problem=06_10

public class EdgeDetect
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Picture picture = new Picture("eiffel-tower-picture.jpg");
      int[][] grays = picture.getGrayLevels();

      for (int i = 0; i < grays.length; i++)
      {
         for (int j = 0; j < grays[0].length; j++)
         {
            int neighborAverage = (grays[i][j + 1] + grays[i + 1][j] + grays[i + 1][j + 1]) / 3;
            if (Math.abs(grays[i][j] - neighborAverage) > 20)
            {
               grays[i][j] = 0;               
            }
            else
            {
               grays[i][j] = 255;               
            }
         }         
      }
      Picture edges = new Picture(grays);
      edges.draw();
   }
}

In http://go.code-check.org/codecheck/files?repo=jfe1cc&problem=ch01/c01_exp_1_103, if the student has a \n at the end, the test fails:

Testing Triangle


Actual output

   x
  xxx
 xxxxx
xxxxxxx


Expected output

   x
  xxx
 xxxxx
xxxxxxx

 
fail

 /** 
   A program to draw a filled triangle.
*/

public class Triangle
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("   x");
      System.out.println("  xxx");
      System.out.println(" xxxxx");
      System.out.println("xxxxxxx\n");

      /* Your work here */

   }
}

Remedy 1: Check that the method returned without an exception, and don't give any points otherwise.

Remedy 2: Instead of doing the Expected thing, just compare with the outcome from the expected run

public class TrafficLight
{
    // instance variable
    private int value;

    public void next()
    {
        // code for next method
        TrafficLight light1 = new TrafficLight();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 2");
    }

    public int getReds()
    {
        
        return 0 + 1; // Fix this statement
    }
}

public class TrafficLightTester
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        TrafficLight light1 = new TrafficLight();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 2");
    }
}

The result is 

1
Expected: 1
...
1
Expected: 1

Here's another one that you might be interested in. It seems all of the graphics exercises do this:

Thanks, I figured out the problem. It doesn't make sense to show the binary file encrypted.txt to the student, and it can't be read in as a text file because it's invalid UTF-8. But I changed the mechanism for hiding files, and I'll have to refine that. I'll put it on my todo list.

It depends, unfortunately. They won't get 4/6, but they might get 4 (without a denominator) if code-check can't figure out what the total was because it died prematurely.

It would be a good idea to have it figure out the total, perhaps by grading the solution. I'll add that to the wish list.

==============================================

Scheme

racket -t filename

Input/output--support it but is it important?

Functions CALL 



(equal? ...)
Name spaces: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14994153/using-namespaces-to-work-with-shadowed-identifiers   

Testers with RackUnit

Unit testing:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/api.html#%28part._.Overview_of_.Rack.Unit%29

Is SUB useful???

;;MAIN


Can have

#lang racket
(provide (all-defined-out))

as first two lines and then use

(require "file.rkt")

or neither of the two and then

(include "file.rkt")


Problem with main

Don't want main for regular work, but then how to recognize main file?
Need main for CALL to feed arg 1 2 3 etc.
Don't want main for test-engine/racket-tests
